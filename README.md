# CORE Day07: Asynchrony-Axios

### Objectives 

- Understand how asynchrony works.
- Learn how to call an API
- Learn the basics of how to use Axios.

### Exercises

1. Get and display users using JSONPlaceholder API

Using the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users API.

Print of the list (array) of users via console.

Print only the users name via console.

Global variable called "users" and, when making the request using Axios, filled with the API response (the array).

Function called "showUsers" that shows in the console the global variable "users".

Button that when clicked executes the function already created.

Now instead of showing the users through the console, it shows the name of each one in the DOM (in the HTML).

Extras:

1. I want a puppy, but I don't know what breed to choose, can you help me?
